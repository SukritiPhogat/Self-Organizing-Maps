# Self-Organizing-Maps(C++)-for-Country-clustering
This C++ implementation utilizes Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to cluster countries based on socio-economic, development, and health factors.The main objective of this project is to identify the top countries in need based on the clustering results.
## Theory
Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), also known as Kohonen maps, are unsupervised machine learning algorithms used for clustering and dimensionality reduction. The SOM algorithm creates a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data, preserving topological relationships between data points. In this project, we aim to apply SOM to cluster countries based on various socio-economic, development, and health indicators, which will help identify countries in need.
## Dataset
The dataset used for clustering is taken from Kaggle, specifically from the "Help NGO" project.
